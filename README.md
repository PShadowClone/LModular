**Laravel Packages Library**

Packaging concept is the concept laravel uses for it's own supported libraries, such as Carbon, guzzlehttp etc. so each one works independently on it's mean purpose with less coupling with the other packages

so Laravel supports packaging system for giving developer the opportunities to become as contributors in laravel world with their libraries.

in addition to using laravel packing system for developing libraries, we can use the same architecture to develop web application as a collection of modulars, so that will speed up development by using the frequent packages that required in almost all commercial web application

E.g. you can use the same user package that you have developed in other application with some new customization by copying user's package which has (user's routes, views, controllers, etc.) into a new application so that's help you focus on the new application's features
